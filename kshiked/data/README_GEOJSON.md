# Kenya County GeoJSON Data

The globe visualization looks for a file named `kenya_counties_polygons.geojson` in this directory to display detailed county lines.

Currently, we are using `kenya_outline.geojson` (Country border only) as a fallback.

## How to enable County Lines

1.  Download the Kenya Counties GeoJSON file.
    *   **Recommended Source:** [Kenya-County-Shapefiles](https://github.com/mbuvi/Kenya-County-Shapefiles/blob/master/kenya-counties.geojson)
    *   **Direct Download:** [Download Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbuvi/Kenya-County-Shapefiles/master/kenya-counties.geojson)
2.  Rename the downloaded file to `kenya_counties_polygons.geojson`.
3.  Place it in this directory: `c:\Users\omegam\OneDrive - Innova Limited\scace4\kshiked\data\`

The dashboard will automatically pick it up and display the county boundaries on the globe.
